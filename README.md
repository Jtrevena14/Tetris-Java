Simple Java game for the classic game "Tetris".
This game has all of the features as the original Tetris, just in a command prompt.
To control this game all you need to do is press "a" or "d" and ENTER on the keyboard to move the pieces around the board
To score in this game, you need to create a row of all 1's, when you do this the row will be cleared and one will be added to your score
There are 2 different block variations, one long piece and one flat piece.
Try to keep the pieces low on the board, or else if the pieces get to the top of the board, you lose the game.
Created using Java and 2D arrays. Very stable IE very difficult to encounter a bug.
